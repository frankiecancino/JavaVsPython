  * Threads or thread-like abilities
  * How is multitasking accomplished?

## Python
* Language purpose/genesis
  * Why was the language created?
    * We needed a better way to do system administration than by writing either C programs or Bourne shell scripts, a scripting language with a syntax like ABC but with access to the Amoeba system calls would fill the need. Python was used in the Amoeba project with increasing success.
  * What problems was the language trying to address?
    * The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files), Internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP, CGI programming), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP sockets).
  * Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
    * C programs or Bourne shell scripts
* Unique features of the language
  * Does the language have any particularly unique features?
    * Uses an elegant syntax, making the programs you write easier to read. Is an easy-to-use language that makes it simple to get your program working. This makes Python ideal for prototype development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability. Comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files. Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of code. Is easily extended by adding new modules implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++. Can also be embedded into an application to provide a programmable interface. Runs anywhere, including Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and Unix. Is free software in two senses. It doesn't cost anything to download or use Python, or to include it in your application. Python can also be freely modified and re-distributed, because while the language is copyrighted it's available under an open source license.
